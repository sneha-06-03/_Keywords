# Keywords
1.**CPU**:The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is often referred to as the "brain" of a computer. It's responsible for executing instructions from programs and performing calculations. Essentially, it processes the data and instructions necessary to run software and manage hardware.<BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/>
2.**GPU**:Graphics Processing Unit, is a specialized processor primarily designed to handle and accelerate graphical computations. While it was initially developed to render images and video on screens, modern GPUs have evolved into highly versatile processors used for a wide range of computational tasks.<BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/>
3.**NETWORK**:Networking involves the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and information. This can include everything from local networks within a home or office to vast global networks like the Internet.<BR/>
<BR/>
_**NETWORK TYPES**_:<BR/>
<BR/>
**LAN (Local Area Network)**: A network covering a small geographical area, like a home or office. It’s typically used to connect devices like computers, printers, and smartphones within a single location.<BR/>
**WAN (Wide Area Network)**: A network that spans a large geographical area, such as cities, countries, or even continents. The Internet is the largest WAN.<BR/>
**MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: A network that covers a city or large campus. It’s larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.<BR/>
**PAN (Personal Area Network)**: A network for personal devices within a very short range, like connecting a smartphone to a laptop via Bluetooth.<BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/>
4.**INTERNET**:The Internet is a vast, global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate with each other using standard protocols. It allows people and devices to exchange information, access resources, and interact across the world. <BR/>
<BR/>
_**INTERNET PROTOCOLS**_:<BR/>
<BR/>
**TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**:The foundational suite of protocols for the Internet. TCP handles data transmission, ensuring packets are delivered correctly and in order, while IP handles addressing and routing.<BR/>
**HTTP/HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol/Secure)**:Protocols used for transferring web pages and other content. HTTPS includes encryption for secure communication over the Internet.<BR/>
**FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**:Used for transferring files between computers over the Internet.<BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/>
5.**7 LAYERS OF OSI MODEL**:The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a networking system. It divides the networking process into seven distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities<BR/>
<BR/>
**_Physical Layer_**: Transmission of raw bit streams over a physical medium.
**_DatPa Link Layer_**: Error detection and correction, framing, and MAC addressing.
**_Network Layer_**: Routing of data packets across networks.
**_Transport Layer_**: Reliable data transfer and flow control.
**_Session Layer_**: Session management and control.
**_Presentation Layer_**: Data translation, encryption, and compression.
**_Application Layer_**: Network services to end-user applications.<BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/>

__OPERATING SYSTEM (OS)__:It is the essential software that manages a computer's hardware and software resources.It acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer, providing a platform for applications to run and interact with the hardware.<br/>

Few examples of OS:**WINDOWS, MACos, LINUX**<br/>
<br/>
**BARE METAL**:Bare metal is a computer system without a base operating system (OS) or installed applications. It is a computer’s hardware assembly, structure and components that is installed with either the firmware or basic input/output system (BIOS) software utility or no software at all.<br/>
<br/>
**LINUX KERNEL**:The Linux kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. It is responsible for managing hardware interactions, processes, memory allocation, and other essential system functions.<br/>
