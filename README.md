# Keywords
**CPU**:The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is often referred to as the "brain" of a computer. It's responsible for executing instructions from programs and performing calculations. Essentially, it processes the data and instructions necessary to run software and manage hardware.<BR/>
<BR/>
**GPU**:Graphics Processing Unit, is a specialized processor primarily designed to handle and accelerate graphical computations. While it was initially developed to render images and video on screens, modern GPUs have evolved into highly versatile processors used for a wide range of computational tasks.<BT/>
<BR/>
**NETWORK**:Networking involves the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and information. This can include everything from local networks within a home or office to vast global networks like the Internet.<BR/>
_**NETWORK TYPES**_:<BR/>
**LAN (Local Area Network)**: A network covering a small geographical area, like a home or office. It’s typically used to connect devices like computers, printers, and smartphones within a single location.<BR/>
**WAN (Wide Area Network)**: A network that spans a large geographical area, such as cities, countries, or even continents. The Internet is the largest WAN.<BR/>
**MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: A network that covers a city or large campus. It’s larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.<BR/>
**PAN (Personal Area Network)**: A network for personal devices within a very short range, like connecting a smartphone to a laptop via Bluetooth.<BR/>


__OPERATING SYSTEM (OS)__:It is the essential software that manages a computer's hardware and software resources.It acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer, providing a platform for applications to run and interact with the hardware.<br/>

Few examples of OS:**WINDOWS, MACos, LINUX**<br/>
<br/>
**BARE METAL**:Bare metal is a computer system without a base operating system (OS) or installed applications. It is a computer’s hardware assembly, structure and components that is installed with either the firmware or basic input/output system (BIOS) software utility or no software at all.<br/>
<br/>
**LINUX KERNEL**:The Linux kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. It is responsible for managing hardware interactions, processes, memory allocation, and other essential system functions.<br/>
