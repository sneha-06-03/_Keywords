# **ASIC**:<BR/>
An ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) is a type of integrated circuit designed for a specific application or task, rather than for general-purpose use. Unlike general-purpose processors (like CPUs), which are designed to handle a wide range of tasks, ASICs are tailored to perform a particular function with high efficiency and speed.<BR/>

# **SOC**:<BR/>
SOC stands for Security Operations Center, a centralized unit within an organization that focuses on monitoring, detecting, responding to, and analyzing security incidents and threats in real-time. SOCs are critical for maintaining cybersecurity in an organization by ensuring continuous protection of networks, systems, and data.<BR/>

<BR/>
**_IMPORTANCE OF SOC_**:<BR/>
_Real-Time Threat Response_: Having a SOC enables organizations to detect and respond to security incidents much faster than they could without one.<BR/>
_Proactive Threat Detection_: SOC teams don’t just react to attacks but actively look for vulnerabilities and potential threats to prevent incidents.<BR/>
_Regulatory Compliance_: Many industries (finance, healthcare, etc.) are required by law to have strong security practices, and a SOC helps ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and others.<BR/>

# **FRONTEND**:<BR/>
Frontend refers to the part of a web application or website that users interact with directly. It involves everything that users see and experience in their browsers, including the layout, design, buttons, text, images, and overall user interface (UI).<BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/>
# **API**:<BR/>
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how requests for information or services should be made between systems, enabling developers to access the functionality of one application from another without needing to understand the underlying code.<BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/>
# **BACKEND**:<BR/>
Backend refers to the server-side of a web application or website, responsible for managing the behind-the-scenes functionality that powers the frontend. While users don’t directly interact with the backend, it handles important tasks such as data processing, storage, security, and logic, enabling the frontend to display content and respond to user actions effectively.<BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/>
# **VIRTUAL MACHINE**: <BR/>
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system (OS) and applications just like a physical machine. Virtual machines allow multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine, each in its own isolated environment. <BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/>
# **SSL**:<BR/>
SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, a protocol that encrypts and secures data sent between two devices or applications on the internet. It's used to establish trust and authenticate the other party before sharing data or credentials. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
# **FPGA**:<BR/>
Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit that can be programmed and reprogrammed after manufacturing. It's essentially a highly flexible and reusable digital circuit.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# **ISP**: <BR/>
Internet Service Provider (ISP) is a company that provides internet access and related services to customers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

# DSL:<BR/>
DSL stands for Digital Subscriber Line. It is a technology used to transmit high-speed internet over traditional telephone lines. DSL allows for internet and voice services to be used simultaneously, enabling faster data rates than standard dial-up connections. There are different types of DSL, such as ADSL (Asymmetric DSL), which is more common for residential use, and SDSL (Symmetric DSL), which provides equal upload and download speeds. DSL is popular in many areas due to its ability to leverage existing infrastructure.<BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/>
#CABLE:
Cable internet is a high-speed internet service that uses coaxial cable lines, the same infrastructure that delivers cable television. It typically provides faster speeds than DSL because it can carry more data.
