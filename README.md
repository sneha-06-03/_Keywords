# Keywords
**CPU**:The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is often referred to as the "brain" of a computer. It's responsible for executing instructions from programs and performing calculations. Essentially, it processes the data and instructions necessary to run software and manage hardware.<BR/>

_**NETWORK TYPES**_:<BR/>
<BR/>
**LAN (Local Area Network)**: A network covering a small geographical area, like a home or office. It’s typically used to connect devices like computers, printers, and smartphones within a single location.<BR/>
**WAN (Wide Area Network)**: A network that spans a large geographical area, such as cities, countries, or even continents. The Internet is the largest WAN.<BR/>
**MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: A network that covers a city or large campus. It’s larger than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.<BR/>
**PAN (Personal Area Network)**: A network for personal devices within a very short range, like connecting a smartphone to a laptop via Bluetooth.<BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/>
**INTERNET**:The Internet is a vast, global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate with each other using standard protocols. It allows people and devices to exchange information, access resources, and interact across the world. <BR/>

_**INTERNET PROTOCOLS**_:<BR/>
<BR/>
**TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**:The foundational suite of protocols for the Internet. TCP handles data transmission, ensuring packets are delivered correctly and in order, while IP handles addressing and routing.<BR/>
**HTTP/HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol/Secure)**:Protocols used for transferring web pages and other content. HTTPS includes encryption for secure communication over the Internet.<BR/>
**FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**:Used for transferring files between computers over the Internet.<BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/>
**7 LAYERS OF OSI MODEL**:The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a networking system. It divides the networking process into seven distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities<BR/>

**_Physical Layer_**: Transmission of raw bit streams over a physical medium.<BR/>
**_DatPa Link Layer_**: Error detection and correction, framing, and MAC addressing.<BR/>
**_Network Layer_**: Routing of data packets across networks.<BR/>
**_Transport Layer_**: Reliable data transfer and flow control.<BR/>
**_Session Layer_**: Session management and control.<BR/>
**_Presentation Layer_**: Data translation, encryption, and compression.<BR/>
**_Application Layer_**: Network services to end-user applications.<BR/>
<BR/>
<BR/>
**ASIC**:An ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) is a type of integrated circuit designed for a specific application or task, rather than for general-purpose use. Unlike general-purpose processors (like CPUs), which are designed to handle a wide range of tasks, ASICs are tailored to perform a particular function with high efficiency and speed.<BR/>

<BR/>
<BR/>
**BLOCKCHAIN**:A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger technology that securely records and stores data across a network of computers (or nodes). It is designed to be decentralized, transparent, and tamper-resistant, making it useful for various applications, most notably cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. <BR/>

<BR/>
<BR/>
**SOC**:SOC stands for Security Operations Center, a centralized unit within an organization that focuses on monitoring, detecting, responding to, and analyzing security incidents and threats in real-time. SOCs are critical for maintaining cybersecurity in an organization by ensuring continuous protection of networks, systems, and data.<BR/>

<BR/>
**_IMPORTANCE OF SOC_**:<BR/>
Real-Time Threat Response: Having a SOC enables organizations to detect and respond to security incidents much faster than they could without one.<BR/>
Proactive Threat Detection: SOC teams don’t just react to attacks but actively look for vulnerabilities and potential threats to prevent incidents.<BR/>
Regulatory Compliance: Many industries (finance, healthcare, etc.) are required by law to have strong security practices, and a SOC helps ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and others.<BR/>
